# FAQ
What is this distro even about?

This distribution allows you to install arch (manually or with installation script) easily, (or even gentoo and slackware in future) with really good stuff like browser and terminal.


Why do i need it?

To be honest, you can even just not use it. I created this arch fork, only for people that limited with touchscreen. I want to make people install it easily, but also manually for best unbloatware OS.


Is it the regular arch?

Of course. Just added graphical interface and some apps.


It simple?

Of course.


You mention gentoo and slackware. Why do we need gentoo if it already have live cd?

And you will be absolutly right! However, KDE is very bad in gentoo. Because you can't connect bluetooth in it or even use virtual keyboard!


# Installation
You can download it from releases. Checksum is also included.

# Gentoo & Slackware
They will be included later... really later.
